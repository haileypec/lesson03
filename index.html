          <h3>Fandom Fiction Reimagined</h3>
          <div id="banner"></div><img src="images/Gf.png" alt="Goblet of Fire" class="img">
          <img src="images/Of.png" alt="Order of the Pheonix " class="img">
          <img src="images/Hbp.png" alt="Half-Blood Prince" class="img">
          <p> This project involved taking an existing book series, and recreating book covers <br> for three of them. I am a Harry Potter nerd, so obviously I had to choose HP. I went<br> with a more simplistic approach as the original colours are so packed with imagery.

          <h3>InkBlot</h3>

          <img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="inkblot that resembles a brain" class="img">
          <p>This is a project I created in my Design Applications course. We were intructed <br> to form an inkblot, and make a book cover out of it. This was one of my <br> favourite projects as it involves multimedia. </p>
